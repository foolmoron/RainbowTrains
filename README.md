A 3D Unreal Dev Kit 3 color-based puzzle game

Theoretically if you download this repository into an existing UDK 3 installation, then it should be able to be compiled by the UDK frontend and run.  We used the 10/2011 build of UDK 3, so these files were contained in a folder called UDK-2011-10.  I doubt anyone will actually try to install this, so I'm not worried.
